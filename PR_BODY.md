### ThriveHub: Library visual refresh + new sections

- Removed any visible developer tips; moved deployment notes to HTML comment.
- Added **visual headers (SVG thumbs)** to every category card.
- Added a simple **inline SVG logo** in the top nav (no external assets).
- Added sections:
  - **Executive Function & Study Skills** (Learning Scientists, EEF, Cornell templates, Pomodoro)
  - **Assessment Templates & Tools** (ReadWriteThink rubric & notetaker, Maths Hub Number Check, Ochre, NCCD)
- All links remain **relative**; page works under `/thrivehub/`.
