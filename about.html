        <h1>About <span style="color:white;">ThriveHub</span></h1>
        <p class="highlight">Empowering educators to support our most vulnerable learners.</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to <strong>ThriveHub</strong>, a dedicated resource center founded by <strong>Teresa Bruno</strong>. As a leader in education with a deep-rooted passion for student wellbeing, I created this platform to address a critical gap in the classroom: the move from simple "accommodation" to <span class="highlight">authentic inclusion</span>.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We believe that every child deserves an environment that fits their needs. Our focus is on <strong>Wave One Mastery</strong>—providing universal supports that benefit all students, particularly those who are most vulnerable or neurodivergent.</p>
        
        <h2>Free & Accessible</h2>
        <p>Education is a right, and high-quality support strategies should be available to every teacher, regardless of their school's budget. ThriveHub is committed to providing <strong>easy-to-access resources at no cost to educators.</strong> From trauma-informed practices to interoception tools, everything here is designed to be implemented immediately in the classroom.</p>
        
        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>ThriveHub isn't just a website; it's a movement toward a more compassionate, evidence-based approach to teaching. By equipping educators with the right tools, we ensure that no student is left behind and that every classroom becomes a place where every learner can truly thrive.</p>
